30 Day Longhorns commit challenge

I have yet to decide what I'm going to do for the challenge, but it's going to be awesome...

It is now day two and I haven't been able to do too much. I'll try to start something tomorrow.

Day 3! Day Fourrrrrrrrrrr!!! AHHHHHHHHHH

I finally got my ubuntu VM to boot correctly; however, the program is extremely slow. Ugh.

I'm going to be finishing my research poster soon...

IEEE elections are tonight and I'm excited to see who I will be working with next year
